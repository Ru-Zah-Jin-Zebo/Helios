# Helios: AI-Driven Anomaly Detection for Hardware Vulnerabilities

Helios is a personal project that leverages AI to monitor and detect anomalies across a wide range of hardware systems. By adapting and fine-tuning pre-trained models, Helios identifies potential vulnerabilities and irregularities in real time, enabling rapid response and mitigation. While initially inspired by challenges in specific domains, Helios is designed to be hardware-agnostic and scalable, making it a versatile tool for various industries.

## Overview

Helios is built to:

- **Ingest Hardware Data:** Accept logs, sensor readings, and metrics from any hardware system.
- **Detect Anomalies:** Utilize a fine-tuned AI model to flag irregularities and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Provide Real-Time Alerts:** Expose a RESTful API to deliver anomaly scores and alerts instantly.
- **Scale Efficiently:** Leverage Docker containerization and multi-GPU infrastructure for high-performance inference.

The project is implemented using Python with FastAPI for the backend, PyTorch for AI model inference, and can be integrated with modern frontend dashboards (React/Next.js) for visualization.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Easily adaptable for various hardware types.
- **Real-Time Inference:** Rapid anomaly detection with low-latency responses.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Designed for deployment on multi-GPU clusters and containerized environments.
- **RESTful API:** Simple and robust endpoints for integration with monitoring systems.
- **Continuous Evaluation:** Built-in benchmarking and evaluation to improve detection accuracy over time.

---

## Architecture

The Helios project is composed of several key components:

- **Data Ingestion Layer:** Receives hardware logs and sensor data.
- **Anomaly Detection Module:** Loads a pre-trained AI model and performs inference to detect anomalies.
- **API Layer:** A FastAPI application that provides endpoints for anomaly detection.
- **Infrastructure & Deployment:** Uses Docker for containerization and is optimized for deployment on multi-GPU clusters.
- **Frontend Integration (Optional):** A dashboard built with React/Next.js to visualize alerts and trends.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- A multi-GPU setup (optional, for high-performance inference)
- [Optional] Node.js and npm (if building the frontend dashboard)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ru-Zah-Jin-Zebo/helios.git
   cd helios ```
   

2. **Install Dependencies**

    `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Application

### Local Development

1. **Start the FastAPI Application:**

    `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

2. **Test the Endpoint:**

    Use a tool like cURL or Postman to send a POST request to http://localhost:8000/detect with a JSON payload:

    ``` json
    {
    "machine_id": "HW-12345",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-24T12:34:56Z",
    "log": "Sample hardware log data...",
    "sensor_readings": [1.2, 0.5, 3.8]
    }
    ```

### Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

    `docker build -t helios:latest .`

2. **Run the Container**

## API Endpoints

* POST /detect
 * Description: Accepts hardware data and returns anomaly detection results.

 * Request Body:

    ```json
    {
    "machine_id": "string",
    "timestamp": "string",
    "log": "string",
    "sensor_readings": [float, float, ...]
    }
    ```
 * Response:

    ```json
    {
    "machine_id": "string",
    "timestamp": "string",
    "anomaly": true/false,
    "score": 0.0
    }
    ```

## Next Steps
* Model Integration: Replace the placeholder logic in app/models.py with your fine-tuned anomaly detection model.
* Frontend Development: Build a React/Next.js dashboard for real-time monitoring and historical data visualization.
* Deployment Enhancements: Configure GPU support and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for production-scale deployment.
* Continuous Improvement: Set up benchmarking, logging, and alerting systems to continuously refine detection performance.
